# Gossip Project

A Sinatra webapp to collect gossip and share comments about them.

## Features

- Gossips (editable)
- Comments
- Nothing else


## How to use

Install the dependencies with `bundler install` and run `shotgun -p 4567` to get
started. There's no initial database, but you don’t have to create them, you
have to populate them by yourself :)

It should check every requirements of the assignement excepted the "database
included" but it’s more fun that way I think, spread gossips yourself!


## Caveats

For some reason, newlines in gossips/comments are broken on my install. YMMV.
